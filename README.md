<h1 align="center">Greenify4Magisk Final beta</h1>


## Module Explanation:
A very simple module just to make Greenify work as a rom-integrated (privileged) app systemlessly (also known as Boost Mode), so you'll achieve the best hibernating performance it could give, and faster than using the root option only. It'll simply inject a folder with the apk into the path: /system/priv-app. If it shows Privileged at the app settings, then you're good.

Note: 
- Follow [mm recovery module](https://github.com/Rikj000/Magisk-Manager-for-Recovery-Mode/releases) instructions in case of bootloop to disable/remove this module.
- Custom MIUI mod ROMs (EU, VN, PL) might require latest DFE.
